C++ game about guessing the secret code using math

This game is titled "ALIEN CODEBREAKER".
When run, the game will present you with a prompt, saying there's a secret message you need to decrypt, which can be done by guessing the correct sequence of numbers.
The game will generate two random numbers: the first will be the sum of the three numbers, and the second will be the product of all three numbers multiplied together.
You must guess the three numbers that meet these requirements, which may be the same number repeated.
Enter the numbers either one line at a time, or on the same line separated by a space.
There are 5 levels of the game, with the difficulty increasing with each level.
If you fail a level, the game will automatically prompt you to play again.
